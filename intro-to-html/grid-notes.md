```bash
grid: is a layput that has rows and columns

```

## To create a grid

```bash
display:grid Set display property to grid <- 1st step

grid-template-columns:_100px_100px Set how many columns our grid has, they define how wide our grid columns are. 1 by 2 grid <-2nd step

Note: divs are block elements by default and take the whole width but when they are inside a grid, they are put into the grid so they take the entire column.

Second_note: There are no extra spaces between the 2 columns

third_note: Add a paragraph to the second div, it makes the second div have more content than the first but both divs are vertically alignd unlike inline block, they handle alignment better.

4th_note: When we have more elements than columns, it wraps around and creates new rows

grid-template-columns:_100px_1fr"
1fr(free_space):
1fr means: "take up 1 remaining free space"

Example:
grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr;

The first column is fixed at 100px.
The second column takes up all the space thatâ€™s left over.
If the container is 300px wide,
the second column will be 200px (300px - 100px = 200px).

Bonus:
You can use multiple fr units like:
grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
This means:
- First column = 1 part
- Second column = 2 parts (twice as wide as the first one)

```
