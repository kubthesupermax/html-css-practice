```bash
display: flex Set display property to flex <- 1st step

flex-direction: row Aligns the child elements horizontally in a row <- 2nd step

Automatic height adjustment Child divs adjust their height automatically based on content (e.g., the second div grows taller due to the <p> tag) <- 3rd step

No need for float or clearfix Flexbox handles alignment without float, avoiding clearfix hacks <- 4th step

Equal height by default Flex items align to the tallest element by default, ensuring visual consistency <- 5th step

Responsive by nature Flex container adapts easily to screen sizes without media queries in many cases <- 6th step

Child elements respect margin/padding Flex respects spacing rules better than inline-block (no collapsing white space) <- 7th step

No unwanted whitespace Unlike inline-block, Flexbox doesnâ€™t insert extra spacing due to white space in HTML <- 8th step
```
